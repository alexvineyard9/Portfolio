# About: 
Hello, I'm Alex Vineyard, a rising junior at Lehigh University currently on track to complete my BS in Business and Economics, majoring in Business Analytics. I believe it is important to develop a strong foundation in analytical and communicative skills, and I find it my passion to learn more about data analysis and data science. During my studies at Lehigh, I learned to work with extensive, complex data and derive meaning. I love learning new skills and tools that can help me find new ways to analyze and find purpose in data in the classroom or in my free time.
